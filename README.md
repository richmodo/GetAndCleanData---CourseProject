##The course project has the following requirements:
-  The submitted data set is tidy.
-  The Github repo contains the required scripts.
-  GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
-  The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
-  The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

The data set is taken from the following location:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

##Data Set Summary
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKNG DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data

The output of script produces a TXT file which calculates t mean of all 'feature' variable by subject & activity.  The table is a data frame of dimension (180 x 81)

Here is a subset of the summary data showing the first four columns (79 feature variables in total):

| subject | activity     | tBodyAccmeanX | tBodyAccmeanY |
|---------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1       | laying       | 0.221598244   | -0.040513953  |
